This is indicated by a number that is then added directly to the relevant Characteristic bonus. For example, a creature with a Strength of 41 normally has a Strength bonus of 4. If the creature had Unnatural Strength (3) then its Strength bonus increases to 7 (4+3). A creature can have this trait more than once, but each time must be applied to a new characteristic. Successful tests using a characteristic tied to this trait gain a number of bonus degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value.</p>","source":"","benefit":"Increases one characteristic bonus."},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[],"_id":"FfBcIbIVSOg7lKva"}
